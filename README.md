# STM32-Design_1
STM 32 Project
work in progress, will update soon with layout, trace and what to improve Descriptions ðŸ”¥

<h2>Project Description:</h2>

The STM32 Design project's primary focus is to provide experiance working with the STM microcontroller and microcontrollers in general. The board utilizes an external clock, bypass capacitors, analog filtering,
and a mirco Usb port for power and coding. Also the Board includes the SWD pins for debugig, as well as UART and I2C capabilities. This project was used to deepen my understanding of various aspects of PCB design and microcontroller implementation.

<h2>Skills Learned:</h2>

- PCB Design and Layout  
- Microcontroller implementation and Noise Filtering
- External Cystal Oscillator implementation
- Stitching Vias
- Proper Grouding
- Mounting Holes
- Proper Schematic Layout

<h2>Tools Used:</h2> 

- Kicad for PCB Layout and Design  
- STM 32 Cube IDE

Decoupling and power of the STM32F103C8T6:

For every VDD pin, I placed a corresponding 100nF capacitor for noise filtering as well as including a 10uF for more filtering. For the VDDA pin, I utilized a ferrite bead and some more capacitors to filter out any digital noise from the Analog power.

NRST and BOOT0 circuits:

The NRST Pin is the reset pin with inverted logic, meaning the microcontroller will be put into reset mode when the pin is pulled low. The STM32 microcontrollers contain an internal pull-up resistor so the NRST pin can be left floating. I included a 100nF decoupling capacitor to prevent the pin from resetting from any noise or induced currents. The BOOT0 pin when pulled low will allow the microcontroller to run the program already flashed on it, so to program the microcontroller with USB, UART, or I2C, I've added a switch to pull the pin high when the user wants to reprogram the device.

Crystal Occilator and capacitor circuit:

this part of the schematic details the external 16 MHz crystal oscillator and the external capacitors for proper operation of the crystal oscillator. The value was calculated by doubling the load capacitance of the crystal minus any stray capacitance which gave me around 10pF for this crystal oscillator.

USB Micro and SWDIO/SWCLK circuits:

The power pins from the micro USB B are connected to ground and VBUS, which connects to the 5v-3.3v power regulator on the board. The differential pair is connected directly to the microcontroller with the D+ line connected to a pull-up resistor for the microcontroller to detect the USB as the correct version. The SWD pins are PA13 and PA14 on the microcontroller and connected to a 4-pin connector surrounded by 3.3v and ground for proper signal integrity.

Final Microcontroller (and USB) Schematic:

The UART and I2C pins are connected to their own 4 pin connectors with pull up resistors on the I2C wires connected to 3.3v

Final Power supply Schematic:

This 5v-3.3v power supply is similar to the 5v project I did with 22u decoupling capacitors to filter out any noise on both sides of the AMS1117 IC. I also included a red power indicating Led that runs at a few mA.

Video i'm basing this project on:

I am mainly using the schematic for the STM32 board, but designing the layout and component placement myself using the tips from the video to decide component placement.
